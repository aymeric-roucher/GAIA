      "\n",
      "### Steps to Follow:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Download the Video**:\n",
      "   - Use `youtube-dl` or any video downloader to download the video.\n",
      "   ```sh\n",
      "   youtube-dl https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1vXCYZAYYM\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Extract Frames from the Video**:\n",
      "   - Use `ffmpeg` or similar software to extract frames at regular intervals (e.g. one frame per second).\n",
      "   ```sh\n",
      "   ffmpeg -i input_video.mp4 -vf \"fps=1\" frame_04d.png\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Inspect the Frames**:\n",
      "   - Manually inspect each extracted frame to count the number of bird species. You can do this using image viewers or software capable of discerning bird species.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Manual Identification:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Visual Inspection**: Open each frame using an image viewer and carefully note the different species visible.\n",
      "- **Bird Guide**: Utilize a bird guide or application for accurate bird species identification.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Record the Results:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Note timestamps or frame numbers where multiple species appear together.\n",
      "- Count and record the distinct species visible in each of these frames.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Highest Count:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Identify which frame or timestamp has the highest count of distinct bird species visible simultaneously.\n",

      "### Example of Recording Data:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Frame 0001**: 3 species (sparrow robin blue jay)\n",
      "- **Frame 0023**: 4 species (sparrow robin blue jay cardinal)\n",
      "- **Frame 0045**: 2 species (sparrow robin)\n",
      "\n",
      "In the example above the highest number of bird species visible simultaneously is 4 species in \"Frame 0023.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion:\n",
      "\n",
      "Performing the above steps will lead you to identify the exact moment and frame with the highest number of bird species visible at the same time in the video. Since I cannot perform the video or image processing directly detailed manual inspection is necessary to achieve accurate results. cannot be normalized to number str.\n",
