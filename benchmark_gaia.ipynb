       "150   I'm making a grocery list for my mom, but she's a professor of botany and she's a real stickler when it comes to categorizing things. I need to add different foods to different categories on the grocery list, but if I make a mistake, she won't buy anything inserted in the wrong category. Here's the list I have so far:\\n\\nmilk, eggs, flour, whole bean coffee, Oreos, sweet potatoes, fresh basil, plums, green beans, rice, corn, bell pepper, whole allspice, acorns, broccoli, celery, zucchini, lettuce, peanuts\\n\\nI need to make headings for the fruits and vegetables. Could you please create a list of just the vegetables from my list? If you could do that, then I can figure out how to categorize the rest of the list into the appropriate categories. But remember that my mom is a real stickler, so make sure that no botanical fruits end up on the vegetable list, or she won't get them when she's at the store. Please alphabetize the list of vegetables, and place each item in a comma separated list.   \n",

Our professor sprung it on us at the end of class Friday, and I'm still trying to figure it out. The question he asked us was about an anagram. I've attached an audio recording of the question that he asked, so if you could please take a listen and give me the answer, I'd really appreciate the help. Please limit your response to the anagram text that could be generated from the original line which fulfills the professor's request, without any other commentary. Also, please don't include any punctuation in your response.   \n",
